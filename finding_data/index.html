      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Data reuse saves time and accelerates the pace of scientific discovery, so investigating how to put together existing data sets is totally a worthwhile effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        This exercise will walk you through some open data sources and some templates for assessing and documenting the data you collect/use.
      </p>

          <p>
            Break into groups of 2-5 people. Take a look a the following open data resources and consider the type of data you might like to work with; keep in mind data formats and licenses before you pick your data

            Identify a note taker or yourself who can flag datasets you like and start looking into using them for your project.

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Interview your data</h1>
          <time>20-30 minutes</time>
          <p>
            Using the <a href="https://github.com/mozillascience/working-open-workshop/blob/gh-pages/handouts/data_reuse_plan_template.md">
            Data Reuse Plan Template</a> as a guide, members of the group ask questions
            of about these data sets while the note taker records responses.
            The note taker can (and is encouraged) to ask questions too.  As you ask questions,
            think about how you would (or if you could) respond to a similar question about your
            data set. The purpose of this is to investigate the origin and validity of the data and know loads about it before you start munging.

        <section class="term">
          <h3>Open Data</h3>
          <p>
            Data that is made easily and freely available for anyone to access, use, and
            share without restrictions, the possible exception being a requirement of
            attribution.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="term">
          <h3>Metadata</h3>
          <p>
            Information that describes, explains, locates, or in some way makes it easier to
            find, access, and use a resource (in this case, data). For example, metadata for
            a photograph may include the name of the photographer, when and where it was taken,
            as well as the type of camera and settings used to take the photograph.
          </p>

        <section class="term">
          <h3>Licensing</h3>
          <p>
            A license gives explicit permissions for the use of something. This is particularly
            important if you want to make your data open as some jurisdictions assign
            copyrights to data sets which limit their use. There are several types of
            licenses that are in common use for data. You can read more about them
            here: <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data">
            http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data</a>.

        <section class="term">
          <h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
          <p>
            These are a set of predefined rules for the naming and structure of folders, files,
            field names, etc. (E.g. All files begin with a date, location and project name.)
            Naming conventions help provide context to a data set, as well as make sure a
            standard of data collection and management is being followed by all members of a
            team.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="term">
          <h3>Permanent Identifiers</h3>
          <p>
            A permanent identifier (or PID) is a set of numbers and/or characters, frequently
            in the form of a URL, that points to the location of a resource. PIDs are set up
            in such a way that even though the storage location of the resource may change
            over time (e.g. moving data from one university server to another), the PID will
            always point to the correct location. DOI is a commonly known type of PID.
