      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Sensors can bring an authenticity to your projects if you collect the data yourself, and they can also help you observe environmental and remote factors that are otherwise imperceptable to humans.
      </p>

      <p>
        This exercise will walk you through the basics of sensors and hardware programming, recommending some tools, curriculum, and libraries along the way.

          <h1>Review some basics</h1>
          <time>10 minutes</time>
          <h3>Sensor terms</h3>
          <p>
            Electronic systems or ciruits that perform functions useful to humans can often be classified as "sensors" or "transducers." The basic definition of both is that they are devices that convert one physical quality to another
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>sensor</strong> has some sort of input function, that "senses" physical change in response to exitation. They are commonly used to sense energy forms like movement, electrical signals, radient energy, thermal or magnetic energy etcet.
          </p>
          <p>
            An <strong>actuator</strong> has some sort of output function, and are used to control an external device, ex. movement or sound. They are commonly used to switch voltages or currents.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>transducer</strong> is an umbrella term for sensors and actuators, of which there are many types, inlcuding analogue and digital.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>microcontroller</strong> is an small computer containing memory, a processor core and I/O peripherals, you might hear about them in connection with sensors, as they are often intermediaries to sensors and the programs you write to process sensor outputs.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are loads of different sensor types, some commone ones listed in the table below:
          </p>
          <table style="width:100%">

          </table>
          <h3>Types of Sensors</h3>
          <p>
            There are many "sensor types,"" analogue and digital, active and passive, input/output...the following two explanations may help you describe the kind of data you anticipate working with, which will in turn help you determine the data format requirements and limitations of your project.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Anaglogue Sensors</strong> produce a continuous output signal or voltage, and are useful for measuring physical qualities like Temperature, Speed, Pressure or Displacement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Digital Sensors</strong> produce discrete digital output signals or voltages that are a digital representation of the quantity being measured, these are Binary outputs in the form of a logic “1” or a logic “0”, (“ON” or “OFF”). This means then that a digital signal only produces discrete (non-continuous) values which may be outputted as a single “bit”, (serial transmission) or by combining the bits to produce a single “byte” output (parallel transmission).
          </p>

          <h1>Get Started with Blinking Lights</h1>
          <time>15 minutes</time>
          <p>
            To get your feet wet with programming sensors and arduinos, you might want to purchase a <a href="http://www.acgears.com/sparkfun-inventors-kit.html?utm_source=google_shopping&gclid=CIfNoLv3oswCFQUmhgodJRkIDA">Sparkfun Inventor's Kit</a>, and read some tutorials or instructions. We'll include the light-blink tutorial from Johnny 5 here (a Javascript library that lets you program to arduinos with a web scripting language), because it is usually more approachable than the serial/C speak of sensor programming to newbies.
