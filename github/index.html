        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            GitHub is a web-based interface for version control, a way of keeping track of changes made to a collection of working documents. GitHub provides a structure and space for communicating about collaborative work on open projects. <strong> With bit of set-up, and a good workflow, you can make your project accessible and transparent, and create a respectful and productive working environment for your collaborators.<strong></p>
				<p>This exercise walks you through a workflow for collaboration on open projects, and demonstrates good communication with contributors. You'll need a partner for this exercise. And you'll each play two roles: you'll act as "project lead" on your own project, and "contributor" on your partner's project, as desginated in the steps below.</p>

				<p>Before you start, provide your partner with a link to your repository. Your repo should look something like this (with your own content, of course).

			<h2 id="steps-to-complete">Steps to Complete</h2>


			<ol class="steps">
				<!-- Step 1 -->
				<li>
					<h1>Add Files</h1>
					<p>
						<strong>As project lead:</strong> add any new files you've created to your repo (readme.md, roadmap.md, contributing.md). Give the file a name, and the .md extension so you can use markdown for formatting.
        </p>
        </li>
        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <li>
            <h1>Make a Label</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>As project lead:</strong> Make a new label. Click the "Issues" tab, then look for the labels tab, just to the right of the "filter" box. Add a label called "good first bugs." </p>
            <img src="img/repo-labels.png"></img>
        </li>
        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <li>
            <h1>Make An Issue</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>As project lead:</strong> create an issue in your own repo to document a "good first bug". A good first bug is something simple that a new contributor can work on, to try out contribution and get comfortable with the workflow. It's work that's useful to the project but relatively easy... not so difficult as to be overwhelming or discouraging for someone new to your project. An example of a good first bug for this exercise: fix a typo in the readme, add a badge, add a science fox, etc. </p>
            <img src="img/repo-issues.png"></img>
        </li>
        <!-- Step 4 -->
        <li>
            <h1>Comment On An Issue </h1>
            <p>
                <strong>As contributor:</strong> Go to your partner's repo, find the "Good First Bug" issue. (Click on the issue button to see all the issues.)</p>
            <img src="img/issues-search.png"></img>
            <p> Make your comment! Introduce yourself and volunteer to work on this issue!
            </p>
            <img src="img/issue-first-comment.png"></img>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>Reply to a Comment </h1>
            <p>
                <strong>As project lead:</strong> In your own repo, go to the issue that's just been commented on. Reply to your new contributor and assign this issue to yourself (you should act as a mentor, and offer to answer any questions). Assigning issues is a good way to track which tasks are underway.
            </p>

        </li>
        <li>


            <h1>Fork and Branch</h1>
            <p>
            <strong>As contributor:</strong> Go to your partner's repo and fork it. The fork button is in the top right corner. </p>
            <p> GitHub may take a moment to fork your repo! </p>
            <img src="img/fork-initializing.png"></img>
            <p>If you have multiple organizations, you may have to designate where the fork will live.</p>
            <img src="img/fork-where.png"></img>
            <p> You'll see that the fork now exists in as part of your own GitHub Account</p>
            <img src="img/fork-page.png"></img>
            <p>Now create a branch in your forked copy. </p>
            <img src="img/branching-naming.png"></img>
            <p>Name this branch. You should give it a name that relates to the feature or change you're working on. You'll get confirmation that the branch was created, and see it in your branches dropdown menu.</p>
            <img src="img/branching-navigate.png"></img>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>Commit </h1>
            <p>
                <strong>As contributor:</strong> Make a change in this branch, completing the task from the "good first bug issue". </p>
            <img src="img/coc-content.png"></img>
            <p>Write a great commit message! The top line should summarize your changes. Include details in the field below.</p>
            <img src="img/coc-commit-message.png"></img>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>Make a Pull Request </h1>
            <p>
                <strong>As contributor:</strong> Make a pull request to the orginal (upstream) repo.
            </p>
            <img src="img/pull-request-button.png"></img>
            <p>Write a good message to go along with your request. You may want to link this request to the issue you're solving.</p>
            <img src="img/pull-request-message.png"></img>
            <p>Make sure you have selected the correct branch <em>where you made your changes</em> for this pull request! </p>
            <img src="img/pull-request-specifying-branch-01.png"></img>
            <p>Here's where you can make that selection!</p>
            <img src="img/pull-request-selection.png"></img>
            <p> You'll see that your pull request has been submitted. </p>
            <img src="img/pull-request-submitted.png"></img>
        </li>
        <li>

            <h1>Review</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>As project lead:</strong> Review the pull request and leave a comment thanking the contributor... If you have any questions or comments or discussion points, bring them up here. You could also invite other collaboraters to weigh in. Make use of gifs and emoticons here, to emphasize your appreciation!
            </p>
            <img src="img/reviewrequest.png"></img>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>Merge</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>As project lead:</strong>  merge the changes from your contributor's pull request into the original repo.
					</p>
					<img src="img/merge-pull-request.png"></img>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h1>Close the Issue</h1>
					<p>
						<strong>As project lead:</strong> close the issue with more thanks, gifs, and emojis!
            </p>
