      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Pitching your project is an important kickstart to getting started at a hackathon; practicing your pitch can help you define your goals. This exercise will provide some pointers to designing the perfect pitch.
      </p>

      <h2 id="steps-to-complete">Steps to Complete</h2>

      <ol class="steps">
        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Pick a project</h1>
          <time>15 minutes</time>
          <p>
            Think about science and Space Apps and browse the <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges">challenges</a> on the Space Apps site, try to narrow your focus to a few key areas of interest, or areas of absent work as far as you are concerned. Write down these ideas as 1-2 sentence descriptions answering <strong>who your project serves</strong>, <strong>what your project does</strong>, and <strong>what you can accomplish in a hackathon as an MVP</strong>.
          </p>
          <h3>Talk to others</h3>
          <time>10 minutes</time>
          <p>
            Discuss your pitches with a partner, maybe someone sitting near you, and solicit critiques; provide similar feedback for them. Repeat with other hackathon participants, and see if there are any folks who might want to work with you, or with whom you might like to work.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Draft your pitch</h1>
          <time>15 minutes</time>
          <p>Choose one project to focus on, or partner with one of the project leads whose pitch you already heard</p>

          <p>Browse the following guides to project pitch design: </p>

          <h1>Consideration delivery</h1>

          <p>Confidence in your project will inspire others to work with you.</p>
          <p>Try to define a few types of collaborators you'd like to work with, and mention those types during the pitch</p>

I'll need help from a designer with experience on front-end programming, I'm a developer so I'd love to work with someone to collaborate on the architecture the resulting gallery project.""
